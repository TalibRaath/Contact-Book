# Contact Book Console App

## Project Description

The Contact Book Console App is a straightforward and efficient application crafted using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++. This project functions as a digital contact management system, empowering users to execute various operations like adding, editing, and deleting contacts within a console interface. The implementation exemplifies fundamental OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, fostering a modular and maintainable codebase.

### Key Features

- **Add Contacts:** Users can input contact details (name, phone number, email, and address) to create new entries in the contact book.
- **Edit Contacts:** Modify existing contact information, enabling users to update phone numbers, emails, or addresses as needed.
- **Delete Contacts:** Remove contacts, providing an effective mechanism to manage and organize the contact list.
- **Search Contacts:** Users can search for specific contacts based on criteria such as name, phone number, or email address.
- **Display Contacts:** The contact list is presented in a clear and organized manner within the console, facilitating easy navigation and interaction.

This project serves as an exemplary application of OOP principles, resulting in a user-friendly and extensible contact management system.
